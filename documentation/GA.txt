Genetic Algorithms:
 1.Reproduction: Those better fitted can reproduce
 2.Crossover
 3.Mutation: Plays a secondary role , more rare.

Crossover:
k=4
A1 = 0 1 1 0 | 1
A2 = 1 1 0 0 | 0

A1'= 0 1 1 0   0
A2'= 1 1 0 0   1

STEPS:

- Initial population at random
- Create mating pool (objective function)
- Crossover
- Mutation
